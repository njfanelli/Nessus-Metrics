<h1 style="text-align: center;">Nessus Month over Month Trending Tool v1</h1>
<h2>How-To Guide</h2>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Download/Store your Nessus scan reports to a place on your desktop, I labeled mine &ldquo;NESSUS&rdquo;. NOTE: For the tool to work properly you must use the &ldquo;Nessus Parser&rdquo; script developed by Cody Dumont (found here: <a href="http://www.melcara.com/archives/253">http://www.melcara.com/archives/253</a>.&nbsp; This script will put your data in an acceptable format for the Excel file to read.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-NessusParser.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Browse to the &ldquo;Asset Overview&rdquo; tab of this workbook.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-AssetOverview.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Import Data&rdquo; button in the top left hand corner.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-Import.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Browse to the location where you saved your Nessus reports in Step 1, then select a report that you would like to upload. In this step I&rsquo;ve select my January 2016 report you&rsquo;ll need to remember this for the next step.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-Upload.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Enter the month for which you are importing data for. <em>NOTE: the text you enter my match one of the tabs provided within the workbook.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadName.png" alt="" /></em></li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadConfirm.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to the prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadOK.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Enter the value &ldquo;2&rdquo; in the field provided, then click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. <em>NOTE: Option 1 IS NOT CURRENTLY WORKING.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadType.png" alt="" /></em></li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to the prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadNow.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to the prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadResults.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to the prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-UploadDone.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Save your workbook.</li>
<li>Repeat Steps 2-11 for each additional report you wish to import.</li>
<li>Next Select the &ldquo;Vuln Trending&rdquo; tab.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-VulnTab.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>In the top left, click the &ldquo;Refresh Vulnerabilities&rdquo; button. <em>NOTE: you need to complete a refresh any time you import data into this worksheet, this will update the table below.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-VulnRefresh.png" alt="" /></em></li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Charts&rdquo; tab.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-Chart.png" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Update the &lt;ACCOUNT&gt; text at the top of the sheet with your account name.&nbsp; <em>*OPTIONAL* - while the remaining steps are optional it is recommended that you complete them for this will help increase your visibility and will help you to better prioritize your remediation efforts.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-Dashboard.png" alt="" /></em></li>
<li>Click the Asset Overview tab.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-AssetOverview.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>The two columns that must be completed in this worksheet are &ldquo;IP/Hostname&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Device Criticality&rdquo; and determining both of these items is a manual process. To gather a list of all IP/Hostnames (these are the devices Nessus identified within your monthly scan) you need to go to each month tab for which you did a data import then highlight &amp; COPY all entries within column &ldquo;A&rdquo; and paste into a new excel document.&nbsp; NOTE: Keep all data within ONE Column.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to remove all duplicates.&nbsp; Within the next Excel document highlight the column where you pasted your data into. In the Excel Ribbon bar click the &ldquo;DATA&rdquo; tab then select &ldquo;Remove Duplicates&rdquo;.&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-AssetDup.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click OK to the default prompt.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-DupsPrompt.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Click OK to the Excel notice.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-DupOK.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Now highlight all of the unique values identified, select COPY, then PASTE into Cell &ldquo;A4&rdquo; of your Asset Overview tab. Once complete you&rsquo;ll need to work on labeling the Device Criticality (Column C) for each asset.<img src="https://github.com/njfanelli/Nessus-Metrics/blob/master/Image-AssetCopy.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Once complete press &ldquo;F9&rdquo; on your workbook to manually force any calculations to update.</li>
<li>Finally save your workbook.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s all!! Your data has now been imported into the tool and you should now begin to see some trending data within your GREY worksheets within the tool.</p>
